Isabelle Bundle
===============

This is a [TextMate](https://github.com/textmate/textmate) bundle for the

It contains a language grammar for basic syntax highlighting of Isabelle theory files.

Currently, there is no support for symbol rendering or other advanced features.

Feel free to send pull requests or file issues if you encounter any issues.
